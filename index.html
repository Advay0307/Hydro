                    <h2>Hydropower is a clean and renewable energy source that provides affordable power throughout the country</h2>

        <h1>Welcome to AAF'S HYDRO-ELEXTRICS</h1>

    <div id="section2">
        <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
        <p>AAF'S HYDRO-ELEXTRICS is a Hydro Electric energy where we get involved with the Hydro Electric generation 
            and also electric trading, distribution, and services for both consumer and business markets.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section3">
        <h1>What is Hydro Energy?</h1>
        <p>Hydro energy is a type of renewable source of energy that generates electricity from fast flowing water by using
             a dam. Also the amount of electric used depends on the thickens of the dam. This is achieved as water that 
             has kinetic energy can be converted into electricity.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section4">
        <h1>What are the Impacts of Hydro Energy</h1>
        <p>Hydropower does not pollute the water or the air. 
            However, hydropower facilities can have large environmental impacts by changing the environment and 
            affecting land use, homes, and natural habitats in the dam area.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section5">
        <h1>Benefits and Disbenefits</h1>
        <p>Renewable: as long as water exists, hydroelectricity is possible. 
            Low emissions: the biggest appeal of any renewable energy is that it creates no emissions whilst in service. 
            Reliable: the sun sets, and sometimes the wind doesn't blow, but water can always be made to flow.</p>
            <p>It Has an Environmental Impact. Perhaps the largest disadvantage of hydroelectric energy is the impact it can have on the environment. ...
                It Displaces People. 
                It's Expensive. 
                There are Limited Reservoirs. 
                There are Droughts. 
                It's Not Always Safe</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section6">
        <h1>How is Hydro Energy Better than other types of energy?</h1>
        <p>Wind Energy: Wind energy is a type of energy that relies on wind to produce electricity. The reason why Hydro Energy is better than Wind energy is that Wind energy: 
            Wind power must compete with other low-cost energy sources. 
            Ideal wind sites are often in remote locations. 
            Turbines produce noise and alter visual aesthetics. 
            Wind plants can impact local wildlife</p>
        <p>Solar Energy: Solar Energy is a type of energy that coverts sunlight in to electricity. The reason why Hydro Energy is better than Solar Energy is thats Solar Energy: Cost. The initial cost of purchasing a solar system is fairly high. ...
            Weather-Dependent. Although solar energy can still be collected during cloudy and rainy days, the efficiency of the solar system drops. 
            Solar Energy Storage Is Expensive. 
            Uses a Lot of Space. 
            Associated with Pollution</p>
        <p>GEOTHERMAL ENERGY: Geothermal Energy is a type of energy that uses heat energy from the earth. The reason why Hydro Energy is better than Geothermal is that Geothermal Energy: Environmental Concerns about Greenhouse Emissions. 
            Possibility of Depletion of Geothermal Sources. 
            High Investment Costs for Geothermal System. 
            Land Requirements for Geothermal System to Be Installed.</p>
